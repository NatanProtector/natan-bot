The application demonstrates web scraping techniques, API integration, and natural language processing capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **NLP**: Google Dialogflow
- **HTTP Client**: OkHttp3
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: Render

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using Docker

The easiest way to run Natan Bot is using Docker:

```bash
# Run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

You can also download the docker image and run it without cloning the repo

Docker Image: [natanprotector/natan-bot-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/natanprotector/natan-bot-server)

### Running Locally

Alternatively, you can run the application directly from the source code:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Start the application from the main class:
    - Run `ChatbotApplication.java`

### API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can explore the available endpoints using Swagger UI:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/
```

## üìù Important Note

The chat functionality on the web interface is linked to a private Dialogflow account, so it won't work if you run the application locally. To fully utilize the chatbot interface:

1. Create your own Dialogflow agent
2. Update the agent ID in the `chat.html` file
3. Configure intents in Dialogflow to work with the provided endpoints

For detailed API documentation, refer to the Swagger UI when the application is running.

## üì¶ Deployment

The application is deployed on Render and can be accessed at [https://natan-bot-9upj.onrender.com](https://natan-bot-9upj.onrender.com).
